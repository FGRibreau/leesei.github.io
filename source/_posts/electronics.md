## Foreword

Electronics taught in secondary schools is an over-simplified view of the world.
Circuits have feedbacks and losses(resistances, inductances, capacitances, magnetic effects, ...) in the real world that have to be taken into consideration.

[Electrolytic Capacitor: Pinout, Description & Datasheet](https://components101.com/electrolytic-capacitor-pinout-datasheet)

[De-coupling](http://www.thebox.myzen.co.uk/Tutorial/De-coupling.html)
use capacitor to filter noise in circuit
note the capacitor is useful up to the "self resonant" frequency
so capacitors are often used in pairs:

- a large, directed one (47uF) on the power supply to filter out the low frequency variations
- a small one (0.1uF or 0.01uF) on each chip for the high frequency noise
- add an extra large one (470uF) for heavy load with much noise (such as motor)

Transistor has can output different voltage depending on the input. They acts as amplifiers or switches driven by current, such that a smaller voltage can be used to drive circuit of larger voltage. They comes in BJTs and MOSFETs varieties, FETs are much preferred nowadays over BJTs transistors for their low "on resistance", more efficient and handle higher current.

Convert AC to AC of different voltage

- through induction of two coils
- the ratio of the number of turns is the ratio of the input and output voltages

## Inverter

Convert DC to AC

## Reading Input Signal

A pin without connection is said to be "floating", the signal will be subjected to environmental noise. Use pull-up (default high) or pull-down (default low) for a more reliable input.
Pull up resistors are usually a higher value than pull down resistors so using pull up saves energy. Some components (MCU and MPU) have built-in pull up resistors.

Pull-up and Pull-down resistors:  
If you have a digital input, it can have two physical states (that may or may not be the same as the logical states, but that‚Äôs a separate issue). If the voltage is anywhere in between, undesirable things can happen. So there are two ways to get it into one of the desired states: You can wire it to the pole of a double-throw switch so that it connects directly to one voltage or the other, or you can wire it to a single-throw switch and ‚Äòpull‚Äô the input into the other state when the switch is open. So if you wire the switch between input and ground, so the switch pulls the input to 0 V when it‚Äôs closed, you need a ‚Äúpull-up‚Äù resistor to pull the input up to 3.3 V or 5 V when the switch is open. And vice versa.

## PWM

[Pulse-width modulation - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pulse-width_modulation)
[Pulse Width Modulation - learn.sparkfun.com](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation)
Can be generated by a [555 Timer](https://components101.com/555-timer-ic-pinout-datasheet)

A PWM channel should have frequency and resolution as setting.
Arduino's PWM (`analogWrite()`) frequency is about 500Hz, 8 bit resolution.
