I'm picking service that can organize my *to watch* and *watched* movies.
A good recommendation system is preferable. I don't usually do ratings and comments on movies.
For sites that support a single watchlist, I can rate my watched movies with an arbitrary rating.

[IMDb - Movies, TV and Celebrities - IMDb](http://www.imdb.com/)
THE database for movies, but rating is not reliable.
Can have multiple watch lists.
Have recommendations.

[Rotten Tomatoes: Movies | TV Shows | Movie Trailers | Reviews](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
Good rating system (Tomatometer) and movie info.
Want to see and rated are disjoint sets.
Have API for similar movies but *not in the web interface*.
No API for list management.
*Cannot remove* from want to see list.
Seems the web interface is not fully developed.

[Movie Reviews, Articles, Trailers, and more - Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/movie)

[The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
Good related movies.
Have Favorite, Watchlist and Rating.
Have collection to link all films in a series.
Have API for list management.
Can import from IMDb CSV.

[MovieLens](https://movielens.org/)
Innovative and personalized recommendation system.
