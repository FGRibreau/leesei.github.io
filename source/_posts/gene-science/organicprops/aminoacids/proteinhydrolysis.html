<p><b>The chemistry of the reaction</b></p>

<p>If you have already studied the hydrolysis of amides under acidic conditions, you will find that this is basically the same reaction.  That's not surprising because what biologists and biochemists call a peptide link (in proteins, for example) is what chemists call an amide link.</p>

<p>With an amide like ethanamide, the carbon-nitrogen bond in the amide group is broken and you get a carboxylic acid formed:</p>

<p><img src="padding.gif" width="40" height="15" /><img src="hydrolamide.gif" width="378" height="18" /></p>

<p>Now imagine doing the same thing with a simple dipeptide made of any two amino acids.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="hydrolprotein.gif" width="285" height="213" /></p>

<p>Instead of ammonium ions, you get positive ions made from the -NH<sub>2</sub> groups reacting with hydrogen ions.</p>

<p>You need the extra hydrogen ion in the equation (compared with the amide equation) to react with the -NH<sub>2</sub> group on the left-hand end of the dipeptide - the one not involved in the peptide link.</p>

<p>If you scale this up to a polypeptide (a protein chain), each of the peptide links will be broken in exactly the same way.  That means that you will end up with a mixture of the amino acids that made up the protein - although in the form of their positive ions because of the presence of the hydrogen ions from the hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p><b>Doing the reaction</b></p>

<p>There are two ways of carrying out this reaction - an old, slow method, and a new, fast one.</p>

<p><b><i>The old slow way</i></b></p>

<p>The protein is heated with 6 M hydrochloric acid for about 24 hours at 110&deg;C.  (6M hydrochloric acid is slightly more than semi-concentrated.)</p>

<p><b><i>The new fast way</i></b></p>

<p>Protein samples are placed in tubes in a sealed container containing 6 M hydrochloric acid in an atmosphere of nitrogen.</p>

<p>The whole container is then placed in a microwave oven for about 5 - 30 minutes (depending on the protein) with temperatures up to 200&deg;C.</p>

<p>The hydrochloric acid vaporises, comes into contact with the protein samples and hydrolyses them.</p>

<p>This method is used to hydrolyse small samples of protein during protein analysis.</p>
