[Transport Layer Security](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) (TLS) and its predecessor, [Secure Sockets Layer](https://www.digicert.com/ssl.htm) (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to provide communications security over a computer network.

The authentication relied on Certificate Authorities (CA) and a public key infrastructure using [X.509](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509) certificates.
The server register with a CA and sign its public key with the key of CA for a fee. The client, after receiving the public key from server, verifies it with the CA.

As it turns out, CA are not trust worthy at all. There are many instances of CA issueing fraudulent certificates (willingly or being hacked).
