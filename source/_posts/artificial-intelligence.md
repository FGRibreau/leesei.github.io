The term "AI" represents the state of the art technology of archiving it. Currently (as of 2018) it means deep learning with neural network.

AI is any technology that showcases anything that resembles human intelligence.  
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that uses mathematical models from data to make decisions.

AI:

- the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.
- Tasks performed by computers that are normally being performed by human beings with the involvement of visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

ML:

- Machine learning is an application of Artificial intelligence in which machines learn on their own on the basis of previous experience.
- ML could be considered the subset of Artificial intelligence, just a technique to realize Artificial intelligence.
- Three types of ML algorithms: + supervised learning + unsupervised learning + reinforcement learning

In **supervised learning**, the algorithm we are working with learns from labeled data. The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to make generalizations about input data based upon data that follows a similar pattern.
**Unsupervised learning** aims to find similar data points in a dataset, in order to identify higher-order structures in the data.
**Reinforcement learning** is similar to supervised learning with the difference being that we're training a pretend actor in the environment.

Classification is performed by supervised learners. A labeled "training data set" is fed to the algorithm for it to learn the relationship of features and classification.
Clustering is usually a task for unsupervised learners. The algorithm is expected to discover patterns in the data automatically provided the features, grouping the data by the patterns it has discovered.

This is especially important in the development of AI. Through a new research approach called TCAV—or testing with concept activation vectors—we’re working to address bias in machine learning and make models more interpretable. For example, TCAV could reveal if a model trained to detect images of “doctors” mistakenly assumed that being male was an important characteristic of being a doctor because there were more images of male doctors in the training data. We’ve open-sourced TCAV so everyone can make their AI systems fairer and more interpretable, and we’ll be releasing more tools and open datasets soon.
