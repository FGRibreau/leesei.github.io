### Solid Lead Bullet

[Minié ball - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Minié_ball)

"Laws of War" of Hague Peace Conference in 1899 banned the use of solid lead bullets, which expand or flatten easily in the human body, transferring most of its kinetic energy to the target and causing grievous harm. 

### Jacket and Penetration

Lead round will melt in the barrel, harder metal is used to wrap the round. 

#### Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) round

The lead tip is fully covered, the shell will keep its shape upon hitting the target. This has the most penetrative. It is also called NATO rounds.

#### Controlled Expansion round

The lead tip is not fully covered by the jacket so the shell expands to a mushroom shape upon hitting the target. This is used for hunting and create a massive cavity on the point of impact.

#### Fragmentation round

The lead tip is even covered less by the jacket, so the shell break into fragments upon hitting the target. It will not penetrate more than 12 inches into the target.

#### Armor Piercing round

#### Armor Piercing Incendiary round

### Magazine

Magazine can be detachable or housed within the gun.
Benefits of detachable magazine:
- the whole clip is replaced
  there's no need to reload the rounds one by one
  and the magazine are easier to pre-manufacture
- variable magazine size
  built-in magazine have a size fixed at the design time

[Why use clips when you can use magazines? - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjuEJjzon-g&index=4&list=PLzzh7AuEBkElHB4FeRDkq84YUNynOg-Y9)
However magazine are more expensive, creates extra loads for soldiers and take more volume than clips.

## Reloading

Mussel loading: the shooter have to stand up and use a stick to push gun powder and the lead ball to the end of the chamber.
Lever Action (mid 1800): cork a lever to eject empty shell and load new round to the chamber. The lever is usually pulled downwards from the barrel, meaning that the shooter have to ensure vertical clearance when reloading.
Bolt Action (mid 1800): the lever is replaced by a bolt that moves along the axis of the barrel.
Recoil Action (mid 1900): the expanded gas in the barrel is used push the lever to eject the spent shell and chamber the next round (which is equivalent to the the bolt action, however, no manual action is needed). You fire one round per trigger pull.
Blow Back Action (mid 1900):
Fully Automatic: load, pull and hold the trigger until your magazine is empty. Advanced design will also route the exhaust upwards to suppress the recoil.

[Trigger (firearms) - Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Trigger_%28firearms%29)
Single Action: the trigger only releases the lever, the lever has to be manually loaded
Double Action: the trigger pulls the lever back and releases it
Single action triggers should provide more accuracy (as the aim is not affected by the sudden release of the spring)
