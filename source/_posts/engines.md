Diesel engines are more efficient as it is compressed until it ignites, no spark needed.
Mazda invented the HCCI (High Compression Combustion Ignition) engine that can does the same thing with gasoline.

## Superchargers

[Supercharger - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Supercharger)
[Turbocharger - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turbocharger)
[Turbocharged petrol engines - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turbocharged_petrol_engines)

A supercharger is an air compressor that increases the pressure or density of air supplied to an internal combustion engine. 

Supercharger is mechanically driven by the engine to compress air.
Turbo is also a form of supercharger driven by the engine's exhaust gases.
Jet engines has been turbo normalizing for ages to bring the air density back to sea level.
