A LCD display consists of two major components:
- backlight
- liquid crystals (the panel)

LCD panel can be made with different technologies and the quality varies.
The term "TFT" does not reflect the panel type used. We have to look into the datasheet when comparing LCD models.

## Backlight

Desktop LCD monitors used to use fluorescent lamp as light source. Recently white LED has been used to reduce heat dissipation, energy consumption and also allows the monitor to be thiner.

## Panel

tl;dr: IPS ~ VA > TN

## Mobile

On the mobile front [OLED](http://www.oled-info.com/introduction) is used instead of LCD.

[AMOLED](https://recombu.com/mobile/article/amoled-explained-video_M17651.html) family:
- AMOLED
- Super AMOLED
- Super AMOLED Plus

Where Samsung's Super AMOLED Plus uses [PenTile](http://www.nouvoyance.com/technology.html) pixel layout.
