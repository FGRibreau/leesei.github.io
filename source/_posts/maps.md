[Mercator projection - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mercator_projection)
- blows up the earth inside a cylinder (expands towards the polars)
- preserves direction, good for navigation by following strict line of map, which is actually not the shortest distance
- equal shape, distort land area
- [Web Mercator Tile Visibility / Jake Low / Observable](https://observablehq.com/@jake-low/web-mercator-tile-visibility)

Gall-Peters projection
- equal area map, distort shape

Miller
- compromise between Mercator and Gall-Peters
- corrects for some of the size distortion, but does a good job of retaining the correct shapes

## Navigation

[List of geocoding systems - Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/List_of_geocoding_systems)

### Latitude

[Latitude - Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Latitude)
Horizontal lines specifying the *north-south* position of a point on the Earth's surface.
Ranging from 0° at the Equator to 90° (North or South) at the poles.

Mariners measured the angle between the horizon and stars (e.g.: Polaris – The North Star) with instruments such as *the astrolabe* and *the sextant*.

### Longitude

[Longitude - Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Longitude)
Vertical lines (*Meridians*) specifying the *east-west* position of a point on the Earth's surface.
Ranging from 0° at the Prime Meridian (Greenwich, England) to +180° eastward and −180° westward.

Since every hour the earth rotates 15°, mariners can estimate their longitude by comparing local time (probably noon) to a time at know longitude (Greenwich time) with chronometers.

### New Systems
